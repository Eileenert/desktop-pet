# desktop-pet


### Introduction

A desktop pet is a virtual animal that will wander around the taskbar of
the computer. The best known are the [*Shimeji*](https://shimejis.xyz/) or the *desktop goose*
inspired by the game [*Untitled Goose*](https://goose.game/).

My pet is a very cute axolotl. I was inspired by this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzZm4pXVoAQJSw-.jpg:large), to create the gif on
[*Piskel*](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

I chose this topic because I always wanted to make a desktop pet myself, my own
custom pet.

I used the Python programming language.

The modules to download are listed in the requirements.txt file with their version.
